Credit Scoring Business Understanding
1. Basel II Accord’s Influence on Model Interpretability and Documentation
The Basel II Accord emphasizes rigorous risk measurement and management to ensure financial stability. This regulatory framework requires banks to maintain adequate capital reserves based on the risk profiles of their borrowers. Consequently, our credit risk model must be interpretable and well-documented to:
•	Justify risk assessments to regulators and stakeholders.
•	Ensure transparency in decision-making, which is critical for compliance and audits.
•	Facilitate model validation and ongoing monitoring, as mandated by Basel II.
A poorly documented or opaque model could lead to regulatory penalties, misallocation of capital, or reputational damage.

2. Necessity and Risks of Proxy Variables
Since the dataset lacks a direct "default" label, a proxy variable is necessary to approximate credit risk using available behavioral data (e.g., RFM metrics).
Why a proxy is needed:
•	Enables model training by defining a target variable (e.g., labeling "high-risk" customers via clustering).
•	Leverages alternative data (e.g., transaction patterns) to infer creditworthiness.
Potential business risks:
•	Misclassification risk: The proxy may not perfectly correlate with actual default behavior, leading to false positives (denying creditworthy customers) or false negatives (approving high-risk customers).
•	Regulatory scrutiny: If the proxy lacks empirical validation, predictions may be deemed unreliable.
•	Bias amplification: Proxies based on behavioral data could inadvertently discriminate against certain customer segments.

3. Trade-offs: Simple vs. Complex Models
Aspect	Simple Model (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE)	Complex Model (e.g., Gradient Boosting)
Interpretability	High (clear coefficients, WoE bins)	Low (black-box nature)
Performance	Moderate (may underfit complex patterns)	High (captures non-linear relationships)
Compliance	Easier to validate and explain to regulators	Requires additional documentation (e.g., SHAP values)
Maintenance	Straightforward to debug and update	Harder to troubleshoot due to complexity
Regulated context implications:
•	Simple models are preferred when transparency and compliance are prioritized (e.g., for regulatory approval).
•	Complex models may be justified if they significantly outperform simple models, but require robust documentation (e.g., feature importance, fairness audits) to meet regulatory standards.
